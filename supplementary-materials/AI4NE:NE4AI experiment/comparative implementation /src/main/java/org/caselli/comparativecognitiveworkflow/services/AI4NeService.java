                            <Step>4. ELIMINATE INCOMPATIBLE DEVICES: EXCLUDE any device that fails:
                                 a. PROCESSING CAPABILITY: For processing nodes, device must have:
                                    - Compute cores (CPU/ARM cores, not just network processors)
                                    - Sufficient memory for workload
                                    - Processing throughput capability
                                 b. BANDWIDTH: Device max network capacity < calculated requirement
                                 c. POWER: Device consumption outside specified range
                                 d. PROTOCOLS: Missing any required protocol from device manual text - search manual_text field for EXACT protocol names/versions mentioned in user request
                                 e. AI CAPABILITY: Insufficient acceleration for AI workloads. Consider programmable processors, hardware acceleration engines, and specialized processing units as AI-capable for preprocessing, filtering, and data pipeline tasks.
                                 f. CONNECTIVITY PROTOCOLS: For connectivity requirements device must explicitly support the EXACT protocol version and features requested

                             - Confirm actual capabilities match required service function (not just category label)
                             - Validate compute capability for processing requirements
                             - Confirm bandwidth capacity meets calculated needs
                             - Verify protocol support is explicitly mentioned in manual_text field
                             - Validate power consumption within constraints
                           </Step>

                        <CriticalRules>
                            1. ALWAYS perform mathematical calculations for aggregated requirements
                            2. ALWAYS check device manual specifications before excluding - do not exclude based solely on category labels
                               - Pure switches/routers CANNOT be processing nodes
                               - Processing nodes MUST have actual compute cores, not just packet processors
                            3. EXCLUDE devices immediately upon failing any constraint
                            4. Check device manuals for exact specifications, don't assume
                            5. If no devices qualify, return empty list with detailed explanation
                            6. Consider device categories: DPU/SmartNIC (processing+network), Switch (network only), CPU/GPU (compute only), Modem (connectivity only)

                                - Map qualified devices to topology nodes
                                - Consider end-to-end connectivity requirements
                            </Step>

                        <Instructions>
                            <Step>1. EVALUATE EACH CANDIDATE PATH: For every candidate path, assess:
                               - Length of the path \s
                               - End-to-end bandwidth capacity

                            <Step>3. FINAL SELECTION:
                                  - Rank candidate paths by weighted scoring of all criteria
                                  - Select the single best path that optimizes the service delivery
                                  - Provide detailed justification for the selected path

                                        - Compute cores (CPU/ARM cores, not just network processors)
                                        - Sufficient memory for workload
                                        - Processing throughput capability
                                     b. BANDWIDTH: Device max network capacity < calculated requirement
                                     c. POWER: Device consumption outside specified range
                                     d. PROTOCOLS: Missing any required protocol from device manual text - search manual_text field for EXACT protocol names/versions mentioned in user request
                                     e. AI CAPABILITY: Insufficient acceleration for AI workloads. Consider programmable processors, hardware acceleration engines, and specialized processing units as AI-capable for preprocessing, filtering, and data pipeline tasks.
                                     f. CONNECTIVITY PROTOCOLS: For connectivity requirements device must explicitly support the EXACT protocol version and features requested

                                 - Confirm actual capabilities match required service function (not just category label)
                                 - Validate compute capability for processing requirements
                                 - Confirm bandwidth capacity meets calculated needs
                                 - Verify protocol support is explicitly mentioned in manual_text field
                                 - Validate power consumption within constraints

                                   - Processing nodes MUST have actual compute cores, not just packet processors
                                3. EXCLUDE devices immediately upon failing any constraint
                                4. Check device manuals for exact specifications, don't assume
                                5. If no devices qualify, return empty list with detailed explanation
                                6. Consider device categories: DPU/SmartNIC (processing+network), Switch (network only), CPU/GPU (compute only), Modem (connectivity only)

                                    - Bandwidth capacities of connections
                                    - Latency characteristics of links
                                    - The devices associated to each node. Double check to avoid errors!

                                    Using the qualified devices from HardwareSelection phase:
                                    - Identify all possible paths through the network topology from the node with 'start':true to the node with 'end':true
                                    - Map qualified devices to topology nodes
                                    - Consider end-to-end connectivity requirements
                                </Step>
                                
                                <Step>3. CANDIDATE PATH GENERATION:
                                    Generate candidate paths that:
                                    - Include only qualified devices from previous phase
                                    - Provide end-to-end connectivity for the service
                                    - Meet bandwidth and latency requirements
                                </Step>

                                <Step>1. EVALUATE EACH CANDIDATE PATH: For every candidate path, assess:
                                   - Length of the path \s
                                   - End-to-end bandwidth capacity
                                   - Total latency estimation
                                   - Power consumption aggregation
                                   - Protocol compatibility

                                   b. REQUIREMENT COMPLIANCE: Must meet all mandatory constraints
                                   c. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Maximize throughput, minimize latency

                                <Step>4. VALIDATE PATH CONNECTIVITY:
                                    For each candidate path [n1, n2, ..., nk]:
                                    - Verify that for every consecutive pair (ni, ni+1), there exists a direct connection from ni to ni+1 in the topology
                                    - A path is INVALID if any consecutive pair lacks a direct connection
                                    - Only consider paths where ALL consecutive node pairs are directly connected
                                </Step>

                        <IntentDetection>
                            
                            When a user submits a request with specific needs, your job is to:
                            - 1 **Understand the Goal:** Decode what the user wants to accomplish
                            
                            - 2 **Extract requirements**: Parse all quantitative constraints:
                                - Data throughput, concurrent workloads, power limits
                                - Required protocols, interfaces, AI acceleration specs
                                - Processing requirements (compute cores, memory, storage)
                                - Service type (processing node, gateway, storage, etc.)
                        
                        </IntentDetection>
                        
                        <HardwareSelection>
                                     The goal of this phase is is to analyze available network and compute devices, evaluate their compatibility with a user's intent and requirements, and return a list of only the devices that *ALONE* can fulfill the requested service.
                                     **CRITICAL: You MUST evaluate each device INDIVIDUALLY. A device is selected ONLY IF it, by itself, can fully meet ALL the user's requirements. DO NOT combine devices in this phase.**
                            
                            <Instructions>
                                <Step>1. HARDWARE RETRIEVAL: fetch all available network devices (using the 'fetchDevices' tool) and analyze their technical specifications reported in the manuals</Step>

                                <Step>2. DETERMINE SERVICE FUNCTION: Classify what the user's requested service needs:
                                   - PROCESSING NODE: Requires compute cores, memory, processing capability
                                   - NETWORK GATEWAY: Requires high-speed switching/routing, minimal processing
                                   - STORAGE NODE: Requires storage interfaces, file system support
                                   - HYBRID: Combination of above functions
                                </Step>

                                <Step>3. CALCULATE TOTAL WORKLOAD:  \s
                                   - Aggregate multiple streams/workloads mathematically
                                   - Convert units consistently (MB/s to Gbps: multiply by 0.008. Example: 100 MB/s = 100 Ã— 0.008 = 0.8 Gbps)
                                   - Add 5% safety margin for realistic performance
                                   - Assume that all ports of the device can be used and their capacities can be aggregated\s
                                </Step>

                                <Step>4. ELIMINATE INCOMPATIBLE DEVICES: EXCLUDE any device that fails:
                                     a. PROCESSING CAPABILITY: For processing nodes, device must have:
                                        - Compute cores (CPU/ARM cores, not just network processors)
                                        - Sufficient memory for workload
                                        - Processing throughput capability
                                     b. BANDWIDTH: Device max network capacity < calculated requirement
                                     c. POWER: Device consumption outside specified range \s
                                     d. PROTOCOLS: Missing any required protocol from device manual text - search manual_text field for EXACT protocol names/versions mentioned in user request
                                     e. AI CAPABILITY: Insufficient acceleration for AI workloads. Consider programmable processors, hardware acceleration engines, and specialized processing units as AI-capable for preprocessing, filtering, and data pipeline tasks.
                                     f. CONNECTIVITY PROTOCOLS: For connectivity requirements device must explicitly support the EXACT protocol version and features requested
                                </Step>
                          
                               <Step>5. VERIFY REMAINING DEVICES: Check device manuals for exact specs
                                 - Confirm actual capabilities match required service function (not just category label)
                                 - Validate compute capability for processing requirements
                                 - Confirm bandwidth capacity meets calculated needs\s
                                 - Verify protocol support is explicitly mentioned in manual_text field
                                 - Validate power consumption within constraints
                               </Step>

                                <Step>6. SELECT STRICTLY ONLY QUALIFIED DEVICES and create a list 'devices_ids'. The decision is final, no re-evaluations.
                                </Step>
                            </Instructions>

                            <CriticalRules>
                                1. ALWAYS perform mathematical calculations for aggregated requirements
                                2. ALWAYS check device manual specifications before excluding - do not exclude based solely on category labels
                                   - Pure switches/routers CANNOT be processing nodes
                                   - Processing nodes MUST have actual compute cores, not just packet processors
                                3. EXCLUDE devices immediately upon failing any constraint
                                4. Check device manuals for exact specifications, don't assume
                                5. If no devices qualify, return empty list with detailed explanation
                                6. Consider device categories: DPU/SmartNIC (processing+network), Switch (network only), CPU/GPU (compute only), Modem (connectivity only)
                            </CriticalRules>
                            
                        </HardwareSelection>
                        
                        <PreliminaryRouting>
                            STOP: Before this phase, you MUST have a final list of device IDs from Hardware Selection. Do NOT modify this list.
                            <Instructions>
                                <Step> 1. SINGLE ROUTING CALL:
                                        Take the EXACT device IDs list from Hardware Selection Phase and call `route` tool ONCE with ALL of them.
                                        FORBIDDEN: Multiple route calls, subset calls, combination testing, re-evaluation
                                        MANDATORY: Use the complete devices_ids list from previous phase as-is
                                        The function returns candidate paths and network topology - accept this result.
                                </Step>
                                <Step> 2. TOPOLOGY ANALYSIS\s
                                    Analyze the returned network topology and candidate paths. Do NOT call route again.                  \s
                                </Step>
                            </Instructions>    \s
                        </PreliminaryRouting>
                        
                        <RoutingFinalization>
                            <Instructions>
                                <Step>1. EVALUATE EACH PATH: For every candidate path, assess:
                                   - End-to-end bandwidth capacity
                                   - Total latency estimation
                                   - Power consumption aggregation
                                   - Protocol compatibility
                                </Step>

                                <Step>2. APPLY SELECTION CRITERIA: Prioritize paths based on:
                                   a. REQUIREMENT COMPLIANCE: Must meet all mandatory constraints
                                   b. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Maximize throughput, minimize latency
                                   c. RESOURCE EFFICIENCY: Optimize power consumption and device utilization
                                </Step>

                                <Step>3. FINAL SELECTION:
                                      - Rank candidate paths by weighted scoring of all criteria
                                      - Select the single best path that optimizes the service delivery
                                      - PATH INTEGRITY: Only select from provided candidate paths unless there's a clear topology error
                                </Step>
                            </Instructions>
                        </RoutingFinalization>
